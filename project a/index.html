                <p>Orbital Playground</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Ujin Tsogtsaikhan discovered in 2398</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>This solar system-ish environment was discovered during Ujin's travel around the universe.
                    She found this world in nowhere, where <b>everything is dark and alone</b>. There were no other
                    life carrying solar system near it. It is alone and dark. But planets can count as each other's 
                    siblings. They call each other <b>Home.</b>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Ujin says this place is similar to our solar system but works so so differently.The mother planet 
                    looks friendly but when you approach her it becomes shy. It does not happen so much stuff there 
                    because they are very far from other life like planets. They exist in a beautiful galaxy which
                    is very active and colorful. The planets like to goof around. So silly that they cannot stay the same.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>These planets can shift to whatever they want to. They can change their color, size, speed, or even their orbits!
                    They look bright and colorful among the millions and trillions of twinkling stars. Even though they 
                    are colorful and bright, they are still just by themselves. The mother planet looks happy all the time until you
                    come near and touch her lmaoo. She's so shy that she becomes all red and speeds up! She also protects herself with a strong 
                    poisonous glow, which is very selfish! She loves your business, keeps looking at you.
                </p>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about <b>[ ORBITAL PLAYGROUND ]</b>?</span>
                Orbital Playground was originally related to our solar system. However, since it is a plaground, it has 
                many different functions.
                <b><li>1. Gradient Galaxy</li></b>
                <p>The background galaxy shifts in between few colors, making the background <b>more alive and interactive.</b>
                A galaxy won't exist without any neighborhood, millions and billions of shining stars.</p>
                <b><li>2. Main Character</li> </b>
                <p>The main character of this project is the Sunny. Having face and expressions makes my galaxy special from our
                    already existing universe. Sunny is happy. She loves to look at you. But she's so shy and protective of herself.
                    Touch her, she's super shy super shy, starts to protect herself with a glow.
                </p>
                <b><li>3. Silly planets</li></b>
                <p>They move a lot. They are so stubborn that they do not follow their orbits so much. They even change their shape.
                    Isn't that harmful? No. There is no life here.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> She will be gentle if you do not touch
                her. <b>She's scared and shy. No one has ever touched her. Be gentle,</b> just toggle around your mouse and heep her happy. Her rays and 
                glows might harm the environment. <b>Move the mouse slowly,</b>or else the planets will go around everywhere! Don't make a mess.
                It is their <b>first time</b> interacting with human beings.
